## Project Brief
### Project Title: Customer Behavior Analysis for Superstore's Sales Optimization
Group: 1
### Project Overview:
My team is tasked with analyzing customer behavior using Superstore's sales dataset. Superstore is a office supplies company with data on customer orders, products, sales, and geographical regions. The goal of the analysis is to provide actionable insights into customer patterns, helping Superstore enhance customer retention, identify high-value customers, and improve its marketing strategies.
### Dataset Description:
The Superstore dataset contains the following relevant tables:
• Orders: Contains detailed information about each order, including Order ID, Order Date, Ship Date, Customer ID, Segment (customer type), Product Category, and more.
• Customers: Contains customer-specific data like Customer ID, Customer Name, and Region.
• Products: Information on products, including Product ID, Category, and Sub-Category.
• Sales: Sales details like Quantity, Sales Amount, Discount, and Profit.
This dataset provides an excellent foundation for analyzing customer purchases, identifying sales trends, and understanding how different customer segments behave.
### Project Goals:
Your objective is to analyze Superstore's customers and derive key insights that will help the company make informed business decisions. You will focus on understanding who the top customers are, where they are located, and what patterns emerge from their purchasing behavior.
### Project Tasks:
1. Customer Segmentation by Region:
  Identify the top 10 regions by the number of unique customers.
  Analyze the distribution of customers across the regions and provide insights into the company's reach.
2. Customer Retention and Repeat Purchases:
  Calculate how many customers have placed more than one order.
  Identify the top 5 customers who have placed the most orders and provide insights into their purchasing behavior.
3. High-Value Customers:
  Find the top 10 customers who have spent the most (based on total sales amount).
  Provide an analysis of the purchasing patterns of these high-value customers, including what product categories they purchase the most and their average order value.
4. Customer Purchase Frequency:
  Determine the average number of purchases made per customer.
  Identify any trends or patterns based on customer segments (e.g., consumer, corporate, home office).
5. Monthly Purchase Trends:
  Analyze monthly sales to determine any seasonal trends in customer purchases.
  Identify the months with the highest and lowest number of orders and total sales.
### Expected Deliverables:
1. SQL Queries:
  Submit the SQL queries used for each analysis task.
  Queries should be well-documented and explained clearly, showing how the insights were derived.
2. Data Insights Report:
  Present the key findings in a report format. Include visualizations, if necessary, to show trends and patterns.
  Explain what the data reveals about customer behavior and how Superstore can use these insights to improve its marketing strategies and customer engagement.
3. Presentation:
  Prepare a short presentation (5-10 slides) summarizing the insights and recommendations derived from your analysis.
  Be prepared to explain your approach, how you worked with the data, and the business implications of your findings.
